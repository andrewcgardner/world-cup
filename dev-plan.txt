Data-driven development
Two options: Sqlite or MongoDb (json)

SQL Model:
- Leagues: each record represents a league
- LeagueSettings: each record is a specific setting (i.e. fill spaces w/bots; scoring)
  - relates to Leagues via league_id
- Users: unique users signed up
  - can participate in unlimited leagues
- LeagueUsers: many-to-many Leagues vs. Users
- Teams: just the 32 teams and relevant attributes (country, group, fifa rank, default pot number)
- LeagueTeams: teams within each league, their player assignments, and custom pot number if needed
  - Another many-to-many?
- MatchResults:
  - Shared by all leagues, just the raw data derived from Football API requests



I think I need a [Draft/Team Selection] object (probably not a db object, though?)
- If there is more than one way to do it, this could be a base class / abstract class (inheritence) kind of thing
- Basically just provide the interface through which teams (in pots) can be randomly assigned to a player

Ringo's Pot Shuffle Suggestion:
- For Group A:
  - Pot 1: Netherlands (10)
  - Pot 2: Senegal (20)
  - Pot 3: Ecuador (46)
  - Pot 4: Qatar (51)
